Purpose:
    To mirror all the changes from a Perforce(SCM) server to the AlienBrain server,
tasks include one-time database migration and later changelist(ChangeSet) sync.  
    This project tends to wrap the 'ab.exe' command and 'p4api', rather than being a batch
processing. Since not all the SCM actions will be used in migration, so the code is only
useful for simple migration, for now, a feature request I have to get done.
	Personally, I treat it as an learning opportunity to learn more than computer language
and do some API design exercises.

Known Issue:
* During the 'one-time' migration, some of the history(like when the who) will not be mirror
  as the old data, instead, all those data should go into 'comment' value of the ChangeSet at
  Alienbrain's side. 


Notice:
* "Changelist"(as in Perforce),"changeset"(as in AlienBrain) and "change" are the inter-changeable nouns, either of them
  contains a set of files under some kind of SCM operations. The noun varies in the context of operations.
* I prefer OO class rather than plain functions because I think this provides a layer of classification so that 
  it will be easier for a robot to manipulate on behalf of me; easier for loading in interactive session; unit test?;




Progress:
[write simple prototype and small-scale up-and-running ]
