Purpose:
    To migrate all the data from a Perforce(SCM) server to the AlienBrain server,
includes one-time database migration and changelist(ChangeSet) sync.  
    This project tends to wrap the 'ab.exe' and 'p4.exe' commands , rather than being a batch
processing. Since not all the SCM actions will be used in migration, so the wrapper is only
useful for simple migration, for now, a feature request I have to get done.
	Personally, I treat it as an learning opportunity to learn more than computer language
and do some API design exercises.

Progress:
2001[study and design]
