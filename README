Purpose:
    To mirror all the changes from a Perforce(SCM) server to the AlienBrain server,
tasks include one-time database migration and later changelist(ChangeSet) sync.  
    This project tends to wrap the 'ab.exe' command and 'p4api', rather than being a batch
processing. Since not all the SCM actions will be used in migration, so the code is only
useful for simple migration, for now, a feature request I have to get done.(See <Notice>)
	Personally, I treat it as an learning opportunity to learn more than computer language
and do some API design exercises.

Notice:
* Because there is no client view mapping in AlienBrain server as it is in the Perforce server,
  the directory layout in the Alienbrain will much the same like ones in the developers' workspaces,
  therefore, P4 client view mapping change will make AlienBrain server invalid sometimes somehow. 
* "Changelist"(as in Perforce),"changeset"(as in AlienBrain) and "change" are the inter-changeable nouns, either of them
  contains a set of files under some kind of SCM operations. The noun varies in the context of operations.
* I prefer OO class rather than plain functions because I think this provides a layer of classification so that 
  it will be easier for a robot to manipulate on behalf of me; easier for loading in interactive session; unit test?;
