Purpose:
    To migrate all the data from a Perforce(SCM) server to the AlienBrain server,
includes one-time database migration and changelist(ChangeSet) sync.  
    This project tends to wrap the 'ab.exe' command line, rather be a script for execution
instead of a module.


Progress:
study and design
